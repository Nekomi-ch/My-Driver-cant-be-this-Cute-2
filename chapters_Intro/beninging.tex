\h{Defy Orders}

In a service park at the end of a rally race, one that is the final race in a championship. It is a place where people not only celebrate the fruits of the whole year, but also for participants to get some rest to get ready for the next season.

This is no different to the team made up of Nekomi Fujiwara (Driver) and Mason Freudenburger (Co-Driver). They have just barely made it into the podium of this rally race by getting third right at the last stage. As rookies for the support series of WRC2, having additional good results not only gives good experience for both of them, they even might catch the eye of the main teams.

However, given the lack of teams in this day and age they would probably prefer to keep their current more experienced lineup instead of getting new recruits. Usually, they will probably be able to stay with the same team for a second year. 

That is... if everything went well... Huge emphasis on the word "if".
