The touge race has just begun. And the crowds along the mountain path cheered on the three drivers who are now racing each other. The blue Subaru is currently in front with the red Evo and Green Skoda closely behind. There are tight turns from start to end of the course but none of them has gained a clear advantage so far.

Rest of the crew is spread along the entire course watching thier every move, communicating with each other while listing signals from Lancer and Nekomi.

The other two co-drivers of Kimi and Pierre stood a few corners down the road.

"So far no problems so far. But I am starting to hear them approaching now." Pierre said.

"Alright, currently signals are still stong." Alice replied, "Keep an eye on the blue one by the way, she's our current target."

The voices of engine roaring become closer and closer and three pair of light appear among the trees. There they come, appearing on their sights after a quick left turn, starting to go downhill and all smoothly drifted a right hand turn in front of their eyes. Then the sounds slowly fade away. Witnessing a touge race is like spectating a rally race, one second they are there and the next they are gone. All that celebration is just for one moment of cars going quick in front of your eyes.

"Number 41 is within close range of target." Kimi responded, "Almost within touching distance."

Meanwhile inside the cockpit of Nekomi's car. He finally heard a call-out from Lancer. "In a few turns the road will widen itself, we shall make a quick move then."
