His eyes slowly opened up, things were blurry at first but it slowly got clearer in front of him. He looked around his surroundings, looks like he is in a seat of a car of some sort, trapped in a seat belt, too fatigued to even move around his seat. Looking across the black dashboard of the car he is in, he sees a woman with a long blue ponytail with a blue baseball jacket, driving calmly.

Looking closely at her, she has two star shaped hair clips each on her side, and on her outfit, there are lines of yellow decorating her look. After some analysis, it is clearly the 'Mountain Shogun'.

She took a glace towards himself, contiued to took at the world, opened her mouth then said, "I'm glad you're awake."

Nekomi remains seated, then softly muttered, "T...Thank You..."

"I was just going to send you to the hospital but for now I think its time to find a nice place to talk, just between us." She then said, "Also, let me remind you. You owe me three things."

"Well, I think I at least owed you my life there." Nekomi then smiled.

"That's one for starters, but lets hold this conversation until we go somewhere nice."

As the 'Mountain Shogun' slowly goes up the mountain roads, Nekomi regains his strenth, started to sit straight and started to strech himself.

"Be careful, don't do any sudden movements OK? You don't want me to see to lose another one do I?" she then jokingly said.

Then she parked her car on top of a hill, a small parking lot with a viewing point and two vending machines at the side. They both got out of the car, Nekomi then sat on the bench while the woman went to the vending machine for some drinks.

"I am getting coffee, what do you want?" she asked.

"Marble soda will do." Nekomi responded with increased energy.

She then returned, sitting next to Nekomi, with the stars shining above and lines of winding lights criss-cross through the mountain, those are the mountain roads that Japan is famed for, and some of them are parts of the course that they just raced through.

"It was fun isn't it?" the woman then said.

Nekomi simply responded by nodding his head, while making a sound of affirmation.

"You still owe me two things you know." she then said, "One of them you just promised me, that when you lose, you will have to do whatever I want."

Nekomi got a bit embarassed at that fact, with her continued, "You're going to have to stay with me for a while it seems."

"But..." she then said, "I am impressed with your driving there, so for now, you can ask me any question you want."

Nekomi thought for a while, turned his head towards her then asked, "So why did you slow down for me?"

The woman laughed at his question, "Really? Your first question is to question my performance? You're really funny."

"I'm being serious!" Nekomi tries to explain, "I thought I was going to lose there but you somehow opened a window of oppurtunity at the last second, isn't that a bit suspicious?"

After laughing her heart out, she then said, "Well I was really having tire problems at the later stages. You genuinely have pace over me. Besides, if not for the mistake from Lancer, you would have ran away. You've gone quick."

Nekomi blushed red looked down on his marble soda with both hands holding it, then said, "Thank you."

"You're nice and shy, but curious at the same time, it makes you cute, just the way I like it." she then complimented.

Nekomi got revealed his cat ears and tail at this moment, the woman chuckeled, and continued, "And just the way you used to be."

Nekomi just noticed the way she says things, grew a bit suspicious. Looked at the blue haired woman wondering about the words she said to him.

"Oh yeah the third thing that you owe me." she said, "But by the look of your face, I think you are starting to get the hint by now."

"During the race." Nekomi slowly wondered, "Are you my... master?"

She then got up then walked in front of Nekomi, reaching both hands towards him, and gently said, "Welcome home darling!"
